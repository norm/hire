My name is Mark Norman Francis; you can call me Norm. I'm an internet
boffin — a software developer who builds things for, on, and of the internet.

For example — this CV is a website, built using my own static site generator.
You can see both [the source][hire] of the site and [the software][flourish]
that builds it on GitHub. If you need an offline copy of my CV, there is a
[printable][printable] page with downloadable PDF.
