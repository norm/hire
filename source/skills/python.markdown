I have been using python and Django since 2008.

## Professionally

The website of [Artfinder][af] was written using Django, and many anciliary
tools (such as data ingestion pipelines) were also written in python.

In 2016 I worked with [dstl][dstl] on [a Django website][lh].

## Personally

Most /dev/fort projects are Django projects, including [Spacelog][sl]
([code][slcode]), [Behabitual][bh] ([code][bhcode]), and [History Mesh][hm]
([code][hmcode]).

My recent personal projects, such as [evocation][ev] (a personal bookmarking
app), and [flourish][fl] (a static site generator, used to generate this) 
are written in python and Django.
