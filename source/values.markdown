  * I want to work in small, effective teams, not as just another developer in
    a large team that is only looking to add more bums on seats. The size of
    the company or organisation is irrelevant, only the size of the team.

  * I prefer working on agile projects and being led by actual [user needs][un].
    I have been working in an agile manner since 2006; it makes more sense for
    software development.

  * I prefer working in teams with diversity — both for selfish reasons
    (exposure to other ideas and viewpoints) and also because they 
    [produce better results][di].

  * I am equally happy to work with existing code as I am starting something
    from scratch.

  * I really only want to work in teams working with, or converting to, modern
    development practices (testing and continuous integration, using something
    akin to git flow, automation of and regular deployments, etc). Anything
    else is so frustrating I won’t do good work.

  * When freelancing, I prefer longer contracts to shorter, as it takes time
    to get up to speed with new code and just as I start to feel effective
    it’s over.

  * I will only work in London. Occasional remote trips are fine, but I’m not
    living out of hotels or commuting for hours on end.

  * No long hours or weekends, just 9–5 — I'm happy to do more hours
    occasionally when there are reasons to, but never as a matter of course.

  * I won’t work on anything that deliberately results in harm or death.
