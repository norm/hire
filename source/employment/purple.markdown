I worked as a combination system administrator, programmer and web developer,
handling clients directly to determine and fulfil their requirements.

Projects I worked on included: a complete redesign of Barclays internet
banking; assisting Barclays with the implementation of an intranet (delivered
with Interwoven TeamSite CMS); wrote a page generation system to rapidly build
websites in multiple languages; developed interactive applications for the
formula1.com website.
