Working on-site for Marks and Spencer on a project to showcase the use of
agile methodologies, continuous integration, responsive web design and
accessibility to deliver a prototype solution built upon their APIs to help
staff working in call centres.

The prototype quickly expanded from a sample user base to be across all
centres, and reduced average handling time by 10%.
