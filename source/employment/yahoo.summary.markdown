As a web developer at Yahoo, I worked on and launched over fifteen sites and
properties, in multiple languages, including the Olympics 2004, expert
coverage of the World Cup 2006, and the Yahoo homepage.

I then managed and was lead developer for the team responsible for all
Entertainment (TV, Games, Videogames, etc) media properties for Yahoo across
Europe.

Finally, as Front End Architect I represented the web development team within
the European business, defining and refinding best practices and coding
standards, assisting in the start of new projects, evaluating new technologies
and platforms, running training and development conferences, and evangelising
both internally and externally.
