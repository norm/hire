I worked on the formula1.com website, performing systems administration,
website development, and was on-call during live race events. Major deliveries
included: a PostgreSQL database backed custom mailing list management
interface and delivery mechanism (for a 250,000 strong newsletter sent out
over race weekends); hands-off setup of front-end servers; automated site
production tools for the editorial team.
