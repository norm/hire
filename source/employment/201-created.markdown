Most recently helped [dstl][dstl] (a part of the [Ministry of Defence][mod])
develop [a django application][lighthouse] for collaborating on finding and
using links to tools (internal and external).

Among other things I have helped relaunch [Pando][pando] (a web publication
covering technology, Silicon Valley, startups), taking it from Wordpress VIP
to a django CMS with an entirely new design; and worked with [Linden Lab][ll]
on two projects&mdash;a back end rewrite of inline code into web services to
support scaling, and helping implement their new international billing system.
