> There's not much I can say about Norm that won't seem hyperbolic, that won't
> sound like a throwaway, EBay-style comment in the vein of "a++++!!! would
> buy again!!!!". The simple fact is this: Norm is an inspiring leader who is
> incredibly good at building websites. He helped build a world-class web
> development team, he held it together when it started to splinter apart
> under external pressures, and he generally served as a shining beacon of
> sanity and hope in an otherwise dismal time. That description is a bit
> abstract; let's talk details: 1) Norm _knows_ how to build websites. He was
> responsible for the development of a wide variety of Yahoo! media
> properties, and successfully launched dozens of sites during his tenure as a
> web developer. He's a passionate standards advocate, and has enough
> practical experience actually _building_ sites to keep his head out of the
> clouds and focused on real problems and solutions. 2) In his role as front
> end architect, Norm generated a set of standards and practices that guide
> the development of websites across Y! Europe. He effectively cared for the
> standards' improvement and effectiveness by involving the team in a regular
> and pervasive series of peer reviews. 3) Norm insatiably pursued (practical)
> perfection in his work; he was a sharp critic of inefficiencies, and was
> never one to simply accept a bad decision. He did everything he could to
> effect change, ranging from pragmatic hacks that _solved_ real problems to
> well-reasoned white-papers aimed at larger, cultural issues. Norm was
> absolutely at the center of every important debate I know of at the company,
> and he was usually the one making the most sense. 4) Norm is generous with
> his time and knowledge. He is continually available to answer questions, and
> always ready to lend a hand to a teammate up against a wall. He documents
> excessively and clearly, and quite simply makes the team better by example.
> He's a leader in every sense of the word. I'd work with him again in a
> heartbeat, and it's very much Yahoo!'s loss that they've let him go.
