> I hired and worked with Norm for approximately 2 years at Yahoo! during
> which he played a critical role within the web development team not only
> delivering projects such as Yahoo! News and Movies sites but also in terms
> of building best practices and evangelising the craft. Norm is passionate
> about all things 'web dev' and was a great speaker at company events where
> he sold the benefits in even to the most hardened executive. Norm was also a
> great team player, often acting as spokesperson for the group and ensuring
> more junior members were mentored. Norm's technical skills were very much up
> to date and 'of the moment' he would ensure he kept abreast of things
> through his personal network of like minded techies. He was a diligent
> worker and communicated clearly upwards if he could see blockers or areas
> for refinement of the solution. All in all I enjoyed working with Norm
> immensely and enjoying his positive attitude and sense of humour in even the
> darkest of moments. Also I miss his collection of cool toys/gadgets that
> were omnipresent on his desk.
