> As anyone who has worked in large, internationally based teams will know,
> consistency of message/quality points and communication are the best ways to
> get quality work out of all involved. These are both things Norm brings to
> any project he is involved in. He has the rare ability to extract every bit
> of quality possible from projects he oversees, and to get the best out of
> even the most unwilling participants. His passion, dedication, and
> unwavering commitment to quality make him an invaluable knowledge resource
> on any front end project, although in a crunch you'd want him on your coding
> team too.
> 
> I cannot recommend Norm highly enough as a senior developer or architect,
> and wish him all the best in his future. Ideally this future includes
> working with him again.
