> Norm is one of the best developers and teachers I've had the pleasure to
> work with.
> 
> As lead on building Artfinder's website, Norm was responsible for the tools,
> structure and code in-browser for a complex and challenging site. Neither he
> nor I were prepared to compromise on the principles of progressive
> enhancement, but this didn't prevent him from implementing some beautiful
> and subtle designs, with sophisticated interactivity that worked even if
> asset delivery (CSS, JS &c) degraded. This was achieved using a conceptual
> framework for the browser page lifecycle that clearly guides when different
> enhancements should be applied, and which emphasises the importance of
> styling for degraded situations. Norm's diligence early on pushed me to
> accept no less as time went by, both from myself and from others.
> 
> As the company grew, Norm played a vital role in hiring and developing the
> team. He wrote the CSS questions we used at interview, and taught HTML and
> CSS, and how to use them well, to whoever needed. He was also always happy
> to jump in and help people work through how to implement a particular design
> or feature. His rousing call of "to the whiteboard" is one of my enduring
> memories of Artfinder.
> 
> I would work with Norm again without hesitation.
